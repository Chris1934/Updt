# Updt

*Updt* is a very simple **Updatemanager** for apt using Linux Distributions.

To start using Updt, you have to download the File and run it by typing into your terminal:

 `sh /folder/updt##.#`

For folder you have to type in the directory where you have put the file in and the ##.# must be replaced by the current version like 20.1, then it will run.
